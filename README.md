# Encryptor
Encrypt or decrypt files with Encryptor.
Encryptor accepts a single file or folder as input and performs operations recursively and concurrently.
It also hides your file's name (not folder's name) for better confidentiality.

* Windows = Console mode only
* Mac     = No support (I am working on it.)
# Note
* Encryption or decryption of drives is currently not supported.
